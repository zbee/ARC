# ARC

Instead of manually managing retainer plans for each individual character,
which can get fairly tedious fairly quickly, we optimize this a bit and
only manage "high-level" plans.

This means we create a list a la:

- 5000 Cobalt Ore
- 2000 Gold Ore

... and ARC distributes each venture automatically amongst all characters
which are included.
